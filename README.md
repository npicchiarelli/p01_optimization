# P01: optimization

Repository for the optimization project of Niccolò Picchiarelli's PhD.
Here we will experiment with several optimizing algorithms in simple supervised and physical problems solved with Neural Networks.
The base of most of this project's code is the [PINA](https://mathlab.github.io/PINA/index.html) library.
